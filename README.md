# Text Generator
This is a React application that generates paragraphs for your project. You can specify the number of paragraphs to generate (min: 1, max: 8), and the app will create a set of text sourced from Wikipedia.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/lavarinimoreira/text-generator.git
```
2. Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Start the development server
```
npm start
```
The app will be running on http://localhost:3000

## Output
The app will generate the specified number of paragraphs of text. This text can be used as placeholder content in your project to give you a better understanding of how your design will look with actual content.
